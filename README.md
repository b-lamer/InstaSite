## General Info
This is a program that will locally host a site and give you the ip when ran. It will require you to log in, as un-logged in users can not view following/followers.
This is to allow the program to see others followers. When inputting a username into the field on the site, it will return a list of who is not following that user back. 

## Prerequisites:
- You will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you check "Add python.exe to PATH")
- [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) ("pip install instaloader" in cmd)
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) ("pip install flask" in cmd)
## DISCLAIMER:
- This version is technically against Instagrams guidelines and may result in punitive actions on your account (you'll get warned first though)</br>
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** </br> </br>
- The site HTML, CSS, and website Javascript are mostly AI generated. This project was for fun and to practice python as well as learn how sites and programs communicated with each other. It was _not_ made for me to learn how to make sites look nice.
