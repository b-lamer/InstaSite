## General Info
This is a program that will locally host a site and give you the ip when ran. At the moment, it will retrieve your credentials from the config.py file and log in using them.
This is to allow the bot to see others followers. When inputting a username into the field on the site, it will return a list of who is not following that user back. 

## Prerequisites:
- You will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you check "Add python.exe to PATH")
- [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) ("pip install instaloader" in cmd)
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) ("pip install flask" in cmd)
### Warning:
- This version is technically against Instagrams guidelines and may result in punitive actions on your account (you'll get warned first though)</br> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
