## General Info
This is a program that will (for now) allow you to cross reference follower/following lists and check who is not following you back. Both V1 and V2 will work. V1 is against Instagram guidelines but much easier to use, and vise versa for V2. 
These will also be made into a website with HTML format eventually, but the base program is getting laid before I move into that. 

## Version 1
### Prerequisites:
- You will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you check "Add python.exe to PATH")
- [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) ("pip install instaloader" in cmd)
### Information:
- This version is technically against Instagrams guidelines and may result in punitive actions on your account. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- It will allow you to check who's not following back for any public account or account you follow.

## Version 2
### Prerequisites
- Version 2 got scrapped due to strict Instagram constraints, even when it comes to users obtaining their own account information.
