### Prerequisites:
- You will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you check "Add python.exe to PATH")
- [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) ("pip install instaloader" in cmd)
### Versions:
- There are two versions of this program and, due to how Instagram tries to block programs such as these, they may get your account locked. So USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Version 1 is able to check who isn't following back yourself, people you're following, or any public account, but is detected easier
- Version 2 uses the Instagram Developer API and will only work on your own account, but is less likely to get your account locked.
